Versioning and Aliases

A version is a numbered snapshot of our work that we can publish for use in different parts of your workflow. (development, deployment and production)


An alias is a pointer to a specific version of an Amazon Lex bot. Use an alias to allow client applications to use a specific version of the bot without requiring the application to track which version that is.
