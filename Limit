Understanding Resource Ownership

If you use the root account credentials of your AWS account to create a bot, your AWS account is the owner of the resource (in Amazon Lex, the resource is the bot).

If you create an IAM user in your AWS account and grant permissions to create a bot to that user, the user can create a bot. However, your AWS account, to which the user belongs, owns the bot resource.

If you create an IAM role in your AWS account with permissions to create a bot, anyone who can assume the role can create a bot. Your AWS account, to which the role belongs, owns the bot resource.
