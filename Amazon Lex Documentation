Amazone Lex


Specially for Voice and Text
===========================
same with the deep-learing engine that is used in Amazone Alexa (?? = don't know)


What is Amazone Alexa ?

Alexa, the voice service that powers Echo, provides capabilities, or skills, that enable customers to interact with devices in a more intuitive way using voice. 
for training model , when the more customers use Alexa, the more alexa adapts to speech patterns, vocabulary, and personal preferences.

Alexa -----> only for Voice 
Lex -------> Voice and text 

Main target 
Natural language chat box 
Natural language understanding
Automatic speed recognition



Using Amazone Lex
-inputing the basic conversation to AWS console, Lex manages the dialog and adjust the response 
-Easily built the conversational chat bots quickly (We don't need to consider for Deep Learning Strategy)
-adding the conversational interfaces to bots on mobile devices, web applications, and chat platforms (for example, Facebook Messenger).


Supporting 
- Amazon Lex provides pre-built integration with AWS Lambda(?? = What is AWS Lambda? <-- have to learn)
- Because of integration with Lambda bots using AWS can access pre-built serverless enterprise connectors to link to data in ////SaaS applications, such as Salesforce, HubSpot, or Marketo.////<--- noted to read


AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. (can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration)


Benefits

Simplicity : 
can the chatbox within a minute
Lex Automatically create the training model for sophisticated task (for voice and text)

Democratized deep learning technologies: 
-Speech recognition and natural language understanding are main challenge for construction the automatic chat bots in computer science but Lex use Deep-learning Technology. (developers do not need to consider for the training dataset)
-Amazon Lex chatbots convert incoming speech to text and provide to complete response 



Seamless deployment and scaling:
-Chat service can access via AWS console so that developer do not need to worry about provisioning hardware and managing infrastructure.


Built-in integration with the AWS platform:

-take the full of advantage the power of the AWS platform 


Cost-effectiveness:

pay as you go (charged as only for the text and speed request)
can try without initial investment

Amazon Lex Core Concepts and Terminology


Bot 
	Bot Action (Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU))
Intent
	The action that you want to perform.
	Intent name – A descriptive name for the intent. For example, OrderPizza.
	Sample utterances – How a user might convey the intent. 
	For example, a user might say "Can I order a pizza please" or "I want to order a pizza".
	How to fulfill the intent – providing necessary information for intent. 

Slot
	For intent configuration , developers need zero or more slot parameters. 
Slot type
	each slot has a type (built in or custom) 
	size (small, medium, large)

Exercise 1: Create an Amazon Lex Bot Using a Blueprint (Console)
What is Amazon Blueprint?

Amazon Lex bot blueprints is the sample testing bot for user containing AWS Lambda Functions. They support 3 samples 
Amazon Lex blueprint — OrderFlowers
Amazon Lex blueprint — ScheduleAppointment
Amazon Lex blueprint — BookTrip

Model Building API Operations
	Not only provided by Custom function , Developer can access model building API to manage, update, and delete resources for bot.


Runtime API Operations
	Post Context 
	Post Text

Lambda Functions as Code Hooks
	If we want to configure the Bot , we can invoke to Lambda functions and use as a cook hooks.
