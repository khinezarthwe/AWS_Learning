Amazone Lex


Specially for Voice and Text
===========================
same with the deep-learing engine that is used in Amazone Alexa (?? = don't know)


What is Amazone Alexa ?

Alexa, the voice service that powers Echo, provides capabilities, or skills, that enable customers to interact with devices in a more intuitive way using voice. 
for training model , when the more customers use Alexa, the more alexa adapts to speech patterns, vocabulary, and personal preferences.

Alexa -----> only for Voice 
Lex -------> Voice and text 

Main target 
Natural language chat box 
Natural language understanding
Automatic speed recognition



Using Amazone Lex
-inputing the basic conversation to AWS console, Lex manages the dialog and adjust the response 
-Easily built the conversational chat bots quickly (We don't need to consider for Deep Learning Strategy)
-adding the conversational interfaces to bots on mobile devices, web applications, and chat platforms (for example, Facebook Messenger).


Supporting 
- Amazon Lex provides pre-built integration with AWS Lambda(?? = What is AWS Lambda? <-- have to learn)
- Because of integration with Lambda bots using AWS can access pre-built serverless enterprise connectors to link to data in ////SaaS applications, such as Salesforce, HubSpot, or Marketo.////<--- noted to read



Benefits

Simplicity : 
can the chatbox within a minute
Lex Automatically create the training model for sophisticated task (for voice and text)

Democratized deep learning technologies: 
-Speech recognition and natural language understanding are main challenge for construction the automatic chat bots in computer science but Lex use Deep-learning Technology. (developers do not need to consider for the training dataset)
-Amazon Lex chatbots convert incoming speech to text and provide to complete response 



Seamless deployment and scaling:
-Chat service can access via AWS console so that developer do not need to worry about provisioning hardware and managing infrastructure.


Built-in integration with the AWS platform:

-take the full of advantage the power of the AWS platform 


Cost-effectiveness:

pay as you go (charged as only for the text and speed request)
can try without initial investment
