The flow of information between the client and Amazon Lex 


-User Utterances (Text or Voice) - eg, "I would like to order some flowers"
-Client console send the PostContent Request to Amazon Lex
-Amazon Lex detects the intent (OrderFlowers). It then chooses one of the intent's slots (in this case, the FlowerType) and one of its value elicitation prompts, and then sends a response
-User response is saved and update the slot values for the current intent's slot. Doing these steps for all slots.
-Before proceeding the fulfilling the requirement (finishing all slot information from users), Lex sends the requesting information header. 
-If it is confirmed, Lex proceeded the fulfilments to the user.
